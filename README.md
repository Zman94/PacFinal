# PacFinal
This is my copy of the popular Pac-Man game. I started this project purely for learning purposes,
and it contains information not mine (the menu screen, the game over text, etc.); however, all the coding was done by me
using the SFML graphics library. I hope that anyone looking at this can use this code for the same purpose as me, to learn
more about C++ coding and to get experience programming games.
