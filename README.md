# PacFinal
This is my copy of the popular Pac-Man game. I started this project purely for learning purposes,
and it contains information not mine (the menu screen, the game over text, etc.); however, all the coding was done by me
using the SFML graphics library. I hope that anyone looking at this can use this code for the same purpose as me, to learn
more about C++ coding and to get experience programming games.

If you have any questions, comments, or concerns please contact me at zgleason94@gmail.com


***This project will not be modified any longer by me. While I have future ideas for it (difficulties, score, UX), I would not learn as much from those improvements as I would from other tasks. I will continue learning through other projects and open source communities.***
